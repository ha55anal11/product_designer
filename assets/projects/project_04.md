# Mini Projects

## Problem:

Mechanical design portfolios require demonstration of versatile CAD proficiency across industrial, consumer, and conceptual domains—spanning fluid power systems, thermal management, consumer electronics protection, and complex geometric forms.

## Solution:

Curated collection of seven parametric SolidWorks projects: industrial shell-and-tube heat exchanger with modular tube bundles; centrifugal pump with optimized volute geometry; solar thermal parabolic trough with structural trussing; disposable bottle cap with snap-fit tamper features; smartphone protective casing with precise port geometry; continuous-form sculptural table; and mathematical Mobius ring bearing assembly.

## Benefits:

- **Versatility:** Comprehensive command across part modeling, assemblies, surfacing, and structural design
- **Manufacturing Focus:** Designs account for injection molding (cap, case), machining (pump, exchanger), and fabrication (trough, table)
- **Technical Range:** Industrial process equipment to consumer goods to mathematical topology
- **Parametric Proficiency:** Fully constrained sketches, design tables, and exploded-view documentation

## Functions:

Fluid power generation (pump), thermal energy transfer (exchanger), solar radiation concentration (trough), containment sealing (cap), device protection (casing), structural support (table), and kinetic mathematical demonstration (Mobius ring).
