## Problem: 

Traditional blenders are countertop-bound, difficult to clean, and over-engineered for single-serve use. Fixed blade assemblies trap food residue, while cord dependency limits use to kitchen environments.

## Solution: 

A cordless, modular personal mixer engineered in SolidWorks with a 5-piece quick-assembly architecture. The design vertically integrates a stabilized conical drive base, borosilicate glass vessel, and dual-lid system—enabling blending, filtering, and portable consumption from a single compact unit.

## Benefits: 

- **Space Efficiency:** 40% smaller footprint than conventional blenders; stores vertically in standard cup holders
- **Hygienic Serviceability:** Tool-free disassembly allows complete separation of food-contact components for sanitization
- **Portability:** USB-C rechargeable battery eliminates cord dependency for kitchen, office, or travel use
- **Dual-Function:** Integrated strainer lid enables pulp separation; drinking lid converts vessel to travel bottle

## Functions: 

- **Drive System:** Conical ABS housing with weighted anti-slip base and 18V DC motor generating 15,000–20,000 RPM
- **Vessel:** 300–400ml borosilicate glass jar with dual-thread interface (machine thread for motor base, snap-fit for lids)
- **Cutting Assembly:** 4-fin 304 stainless steel impeller with tapered shaft coupling for direct torque transfer
- **Lid System:** ABS strainer (perforated filter) for smoothie texture control + ergonomic drinking cap with integrated carry loop
- **Safety:** Double-click capacitive start button with LED indicator; Hall-effect sensor prevents operation when detached
- **Power:** 2000mAh lithium-ion battery pack with PCM protection; 3–4 hour charge cycle via rear-mounted USB-C port
